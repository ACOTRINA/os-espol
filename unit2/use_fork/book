1- example1: Calculate number of times hello is printed?
So there are total eight processes (new child processes and one original process).

If we want to represent the relationship between the processes as a tree hierarchy it would be the following:

The main process: P0
Processes created by the 1st fork: P1
Processes created by the 2nd fork: P2, P3
Processes created by the 3rd fork: P4, P5, P6, P7

            P0
         /   |   \
       P1    P4   P2
      /  \          \
    P3    P6         P5
   /
 P7
